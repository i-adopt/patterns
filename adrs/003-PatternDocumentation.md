# Documentation of the pattern used

* Status: [ proposed ]
* Date: [2025-03-10]
* Discussion: 

## Context

The documentation of the pattern used might be useful for associating the logic used to decompose a variable with the actual variable description.

## Decision

*pending*

## Considered Options

### Option A: Pattern as abstract variable

The pattern is described as an abstract variable and published as a machine-readable representation. It is retrievable via its persistent identifier. A library of patterns is published centrally. See e.g.: 

![description option A](./003/pattern.jpg)

* **Pros**:
  * might be helfpul for the service development, as this would require to say which pattern was used.
  * might help also other implementers to understand how this was done.
* **Cons**
  * additional object property needed.
